## Overview

This project presents a test to see how many shades of gray can a human distinguish, written with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
I had made it out of curiosity, towards the end of the 2016's summer.

## Motivation

Back then, we have noticed that we were able to clearly notice a sharp change from
gray (127, 127, 127) to minimally darker gray (128, 128, 128), on our 8-bit color display.
This was interesting to us, because my friend was going to conduct an vision experiment
regarding the contrast sensitivity of the human eye under various conditions.

Although it wouldn't really be of any help to my friend, I then wanted to just make myself a game,
a challange to see how many shades of gray I can successfully distinguish.

## Remarks

This client-side web application is made to be responsive in design that it;
- adapts to display orientation and size,
- is very touch-friendly, with expanded touchable areas on thin and small elements (using pseudo-elements).

All this had been achieved through CSS, evident from the lines-of-code on CSS being almost as many as on the JS.
